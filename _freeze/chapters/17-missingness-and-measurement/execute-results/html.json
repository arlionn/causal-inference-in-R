As with analysis, the impact of missingness and mismeasurement is also different across all three, even when we are using the same tools (like multiple imputation) to address it. At its best, missingness and mismeasurement can worsen the precision and bias of the sample, respectively; at its worst, it can create unresolvable selection bias, giving you a completely wrong answer. In this chapter, we'll explore how bias can arise in causal analyses in the presence of missingness and mismeasurement and how to address them (if we can!).\n\n## Missingness and measurement error as structural bias\n\nIt's frequently been observed that causal inference can be thought of fundamentally as a missing data problem; after all, what we really want to compare is counterfactual states, but all such states outside of the factual world are missing. Causal inference as missingness is interesting philosophically and connects methods from the two areas of statistics. Here, we'll consider the reverse proposition: missingness is a causal inference problem, as is measurement error.\n\nThus far, we've made a big assumption in our DAGs that the variables that we've included are actually the variables we have in our data. In other words, we assume that the data is measured perfectly and completely. This is almost always untrue. Let's consider a few scenarios using causal diagrams to understand the impact of mismeasurement and missingness.\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\nIf `x` is partially missing but `y` is not, you can measure the mean of `y` with a higher sample size than the mean of `x`. However, for joint parameters, like a regression coefficient, you can only calculate the value for observation where both `x` and `y` is complete. Many tools in R, like `lm()`, quietly drop rows that are not complete for necessary variables by default.\n\nThis is sometimes called *complete-case analysis*, which is what we've been doing thus far in the book.\n:::\n\nIn the Touring Plans data, most variables are complete and likely measured with high accuracy (e.g., ticket season and historic weather are well-measured). One variable with missingness and measurement error is the actual wait times for rides. If you recall, the data relies on humans to wait in line, either consumers of the data who report their experience or people hired to wait in line to report the wait time. Thus, missingness is largely related to whether or not someone is there there to measure the wait time. When someone is there to measure it, it's also likely measured with error, and that error likely depends on who the person is, e.g. a visitor to Disney World estimating their wait time and submitting it to Touring Plans is likely producing a value with more error than someone paid to stay in line and count the minutes.\n\nThat said, let's take measurement error and missingness one at a time. \n\n### Structural measurement error\n\nFirst, let's consider measurement error. In @fig-meas-err-dag, we represent actual and posted wait times twice: the true version and the measured version. The measured versions have two variables that influence them: the real values and unknown or unmeasured factors that influence their mismeasurement. The ways in which the two wait times are mismeasured are independent of one another. For simplicity, we've removed the confounders from this DAG.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](17-missingness-and-measurement_files/figure-html/fig-meas-err-dag-1.png){#fig-meas-err-dag width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nThe posted wait times are scraped by Touring Plans from what Disney posts on the web. There is a plausible mechanism by which which this could be mismeasured: Disney could post the wrong times online compared to what's posted at the park, or Touring Plans could have a mistake in its data acquisition code. That said, it's reasonable to assume that this error would probably be small.\n\nActual wait times, on the other hand, probably have a good deal of measurement error. Humans have to manually measure this period, so there is some natural error in that process. Measurement also likely depends on whether or not the person measuring the wait time is being paid to do so. Presumably, someone who is entering it out of good will is more likely to submit an approximate wait time, and someone who is paid is more likely to be precise. \n\nSo, an updated DAG might look like @fig-meas-err-other-1. This DAG describes the structural causes of measurement error in `actual`; notably, though, that structure is not connected to `posted`. This is easier to see if we show a *null* DAG in which there is no arrow from `posted` to `actual` (@fig-meas-err-other-2). Posted time is not connected to the mechanisms that cause measurement error in actual time. In other words, the bias caused by this measurement error is *not* due to nonexchangability; it's due to a numerical error in the measurement, not an open path in the causal graph. The extent of this error depends on how well the measured version correlates with the real values.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](17-missingness-and-measurement_files/figure-html/fig-meas-err-other-1.png){#fig-meas-err-other-1 width=432}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](17-missingness-and-measurement_files/figure-html/fig-meas-err-other-2.png){#fig-meas-err-other-2 width=432}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead of the type of nonexchangability that is induced by confounding, this type of bias in measurement is due to the fact that we're analyzing the effect of `posted_measured` to `actual_measured` as a proxy for the effect of `posted` on `actual`. The correctness of the result depends entirely on how well `actual_measured` approximates `actual`. If you change your point of view to treating the measured variables as the cause and effect under study, we're actually taking advantage the causal structure to approximate the study of the real variables. The measured variables in @fig-meas-err-other-1 do not cause one another. However, if we calculate their relationship, they'll be confounded by the real variables. Unusually, we're using this confounding to approximate the relationship in the real variables. The extent to that we can do that depends on exchangability *with the exception of the real variables* as well as the amount of independent measurement error for each variable (such as `unknown` here).\n\nThis is sometimes called *independent, non-differential* measurement error: the error is not due to structural nonexchangability but the differences in the observed and real values for actual and posted times. \n\n::: {.callout-warning}\nAs the correlation approaches 0, the measurement of  becomes random with respect to the relationship under study. Often this means that, when variables are measured with independent measurement error, the relationship of the measured values approaches null even if there is an arrow between the true values. Here, the coefficient of `x` should be about 1, but as the random measurement gets, the coefficient gets closer to 0, because there's no relationship between the randomness induced by mismeasurement and `y`.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nn <- 1000\nx <- rnorm(n)\ny <- x + rnorm(n)\n# bad measurement of x\nx_measured <- .01 * x + rnorm(n)\ncor(x, x_measured)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0.002565\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlm(y ~ x_measured)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = y ~ x_measured)\n\nCoefficients:\n(Intercept)   x_measured  \n   -0.06283      0.00419  \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nThis isn't always true, however. For instance, for categorical variables with more than two categories, mismeasurement changes the counts of variables (this is sometimes called misclassification for categorical variables). Even in random misclassification, some of the relationships will be biased towards the null and some away from the null simply because when you take away counts from one category, they go in another. For instance, if we randomly mix up the labels `\"c\"` and `\"d\"`, they average towards each other, making the coefficient for `c` too big and the coefficient for `d` too small, while the other two remain correct.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx <- sample(letters[1:5], size = n, replace = TRUE)\ny <- case_when(\n  x == \"a\" ~ 1 + rnorm(n),\n  x == \"b\" ~ 2 + rnorm(n),\n  x == \"c\" ~ 3 + rnorm(n),\n  x == \"d\" ~ 4 + rnorm(n),\n  x == \"e\" ~ 5 + rnorm(n),\n)\n\nx_measured <- ifelse(\n  x %in% c(\"c\", \"d\"), \n  sample(c(\"c\", \"d\"), size = n, replace = TRUE),\n  x\n)\n\nlm(y ~ x_measured)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = y ~ x_measured)\n\nCoefficients:\n(Intercept)  x_measuredb  x_measuredc  x_measuredd  \n      0.925        1.083        2.459        2.671  \nx_measurede  \n      3.990  \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nSome researchers lean heavily on the hope random measurement error is predictably towards the null, but this isn't always so. See @TODO for more details on when this is false.\n:::\n\nLet's say, however, that the a single unknown factor affects the measurement of both the posted wait time and actual wait time, as in @fig-meas-err-dag-dep-1. In addition to the problem we have above, there's also nonexchangability because of confounding in the measured variables (fig-meas-err-dag-dep-2). This is called *dependent, non-differential* measurement error.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](17-missingness-and-measurement_files/figure-html/fig-meas-err-dag-dep-1.png){#fig-meas-err-dag-dep-1 width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](17-missingness-and-measurement_files/figure-html/fig-meas-err-dag-dep-2.png){#fig-meas-err-dag-dep-2 width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the nonexchangability is related to the exposure, outcome, or both, it's called *differential* measurement error, which can be dependent or independent. Let's expand @fig-meas-err-dag-dep-1 to include an arrow from posted time to how actual wait time is measured, a case of *dependent, differential* measurement error (without the the path introduced in @fig-meas-err-dag-dep-1, it would be *independent* and differential). @fig-meas-err-dag-diff shows two open backdoor paths: the path via `unknown` and the path via `posted`.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](17-missingness-and-measurement_files/figure-html/fig-meas-err-dag-diff-1.png){#fig-meas-err-dag-diff width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nThe names of the types of measurement error are conceptual. In reality, there are just two forms of bias happening: numerical inconsistency of the measured variables with their real values (independent, non-differential measurement error) and nonexchangability (the other three types of measurement error). Whether the error is dependent or differential is based on whether the nonexchangibility involves the exposure and/or the outcome. \n\nOne inconvenience of the dependent/differential groupings is that it masks the fact that these two sources of bias can and do occur together. Often, you have all of these circumstances happening (numerical inconsistency with the true values and open backdoor paths involving the exposure/outcome as well as other paths). In this case, the bias is due to *both* how well the measured variable correlates with the true variable and structural nonexchangbility.\n\nIn this case, it's unlikely that posted time impacts the measurement quality of actual time, so we can probably rule the extra arrow in @fig-meas-err-dag-diff out (although we'll see below, it may affect the *missingness* of actual time). The measurement of posted times also probably occurs before the measurement of actual time, so there can't be an arrow there.\n\n::: callout-tip\nThe reason that we can have a situation where, for instance, the outcome is affecting the measurement of the exposure is that the measurement of variables may not match the time-ordering of the values they represent. An exposure may happen long before an outcome, but their measurement could happen in any order. Using values *measured* in time-order helps avoid some types of measurement error, such as when the outcome impacts the measurement of the exposure. Either way, correctly representing occurence and measurement in your DAG can help you identify and understand problems.\n:::\n\nMismeasured confounders also cause problems. Firstly, if we have a poorly measured confounder, we may not have closed the backdoor path completely, meaning there is residual confounding. Secondly, mismeasured confounders can also appear to be effect modifiers when the mismeasurement is differential with respect to the outcome. Usually the bias from the residual confounding is worse, but often there is a small but significant interaction effect between the exposure and the mismeasured confounder, as shown in @tbl-confounder-me.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nn <- 10000\nset.seed(1)\nconfounder <- rnorm(n)\nexposure <- confounder + rnorm(n)\noutcome <- exposure + confounder +

missingness\n\nIn these DAGs, we assumed that the measurement of actual wait time has no impact on posted wait time and vice versa. Because posted time happens before actual time, it's reasonable to assume that that is the case for that relationship. However, the posted wait time *may* influence the *missingness* of the actual wait time. If the posted wait time is high, for instance, someone may not get in the line at all and thus not submit an actual wait time to TouringPlans. For simplicity, we've removed details about measurement error and assume that the variables are well-measured and free from confounding. \n\n@fig-missing-dag represents a slightly different situation than the DAGs in the measurement error examples. We still have two nodes for a given variable, but one represents the true values, and the other represents a *missingness indicator*, whether the value is missing or not. The problem here is that we are inherently conditioning whether or not we observed the data. This is always true. We are always conditioning on the data we actually have. In the case of missingness, we're usually talking about conditioning on *complete* observations, e.g., we've measured all the variables that we need for the analysis. In the best case, missingness is unrelated to the causal structure of the research question and the only impact is a reduction in sample size (and thus precision). \n\nIn @fig-missing-dag-1, though, we're saying that missigness of `actual` is related to the posted wait times as well as to an unknown mechanism. The unknown mechanism is random, but mechanism related to posted wait times is not, since it's the exposure. However, in this simple DAG, conditioning on missingness does not open a backdoor path between `actual` and `posted`. (It does bias the relationship between `unknown` and `posted`, but we don't care about that relationship even if we could estimate it.) The only open path in @fig-missing-dag-2 is the one from `posted` to `actual`.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](17-missingness-and-measurement_files/figure-html/fig-missing-dag-1.png){#fig-missing-dag-1 width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](17-missingness-and-measurement_files/figure-html/fig-missing-dag-2.png){#fig-missing-dag-2 width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause we don't have exchangability issues, we should still be able to estimate a causal effect. Missingness still impacts the analysis, though. The causal effect in this case is *recoverable*; we can still estimate it without bias with complete-case analysis. However, because we're only using observations with complete observation, we have a smaller sample size and thus reduced precision. We are also now unable to correctly estimate the *mean* of actual wait times because values are systematically missing by posted wait time.\n\nIs it feasible that the the missingness of `actual` is related to its own values? It could be that the actual wait times are so fast, a rider doesn't have time to enter it, or it could be such a long wait that they decide to get out of line. @fig-missing-dag-actual-1 depicts a relationship like this.\n\nWhen missingness is collider, conditioning on it may induce bias. In this case, whether or not actual wait times was measured is a descendant of both the actual and posted wait times. Conditioning on it opens a backdoor path, creating nonexchangability, as in @fig-missing-dag-actual-2. In this case, there is no way to close the backdoor paths opened by conditioning on missingness.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](17-missingness-and-measurement_files/figure-html/fig-missing-dag-actual-1.png){#fig-missing-dag-actual-1 width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](17-missingness-and-measurement_files/figure-html/fig-missing-dag-actual-2.png){#fig-missing-dag-actual-2 width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat effects we can recover is more complicated than determining backdoor paths alone. When there are no backdoor paths, we can calculate the causal effect, but we may not be able to calculate other statistics like the mean of the exposure or outcome. When conditioning on missingness opens a backdoor path, sometimes we can close it (and thus estimate a causal effect), and sometimes we can't.\n\nConsider the DAGs in @fig-missing-dags-sim, where `a` is `actual`, `p` is `posted`, `u` is `unknown`, and `m` is `missing`. @fig-recoverables presents the mean of `posted`, `actual`, and the estimated causal effect of `posted` on `actual` for data simulated from these DAGs. Without any missingness, of course, we can estimate all three. For DAG 1, we can estimate all three, as well, but because of missingness, we have a reduced sample size and thus worse precision. For DAG 2, we can calculate the mean of `posted` and the causal effect but not the mean of `actual`. For DAG 3, we also can't calculate the causal effect. In DAG 4, we can calculate the mean of `actual` and the causal effect but not the mean of `posted`, and in DAG 5, we can calculate the mean of `actual`, but that's it. \n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](17-missingness-and-measurement_files/figure-html/fig-missing-dags-sim-1.png){#fig-missing-dags-sim width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](17-missingness-and-measurement_files/figure-html/fig-recoverables-1.png){#fig-recoverables width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nSee @TODO for a comprehensive overview on what effects are recoverable from different structures of missingness.\n\nAs in measurement error, the confounders in the causal model may also contribute to the missingness of actual wait time, say if season or temperature influences whether TouringPlans sends someone in to do a measurement. In these data, the confounders are all observed, but missingness in confounders can cause both residual confounding and selection bias from stratification on complete cases. \n\n::: {.callout-tip}\nIn the grand tradition of statisticians being bad at naming things, you'll also commonly see missingness discussed in terms of *missing completely at random*, *missing at random*, and *missing not at random*.\n\nIn the case of causal models, these ideas are explained by the causal structure of missingness and the availability of variables and values related to that structure in your data.\n\n* **Missing completely at random (MCAR)**: there are missing values, but the causes of missingness are such that the missingness process is unrelated to the causal structure of your question. In other words, the only problem in missingness is a reduction in sample size.\n* **Missing at random (MAR)**: the causes of missingness are related to the causal structure of the research problem, but it only depends on the variables and values in the data that we've actually observed. \n* **Missing not at random (MNAR)**: the causes of missingness are related to the causal structure of the research problem, but this process is related to values we are missing. A classic example of this is when a variable's missingness is impacted by itself, e.g. higher values of `x` are more likely to be missing in `x`. We don't have that information because, by definition, it's missing. \n\nThese terms don't always tell you what to do next, so we'll avoid them in favor of explicitly describing the missingness generation process.\n::: \n\nIs measurement error missingness, because we're missing the true value? Is missingness measurement error, because we've badly mismeasured some values as `NA`? \n\nWe've presented the two problems different structurally, where measurement error is represented by calculating causal effects of proxy variables and missingness is calculating causal effects of the true variables conditional on missingness. These two structures better illuminate the biases that emerge from the two situations.\n\nThat said, it can also be helpful to think of them from the other perspective. For instance, if you think about measurement error as a missingness problem, it allows you to use techniques like multiple imputation to address it.\n\nOf course, often we are doing *both* because data are both missing for some observations and observed but mismeasured for others. \n\nNow lets discuss some analytic techniques for addressing measurement error and missingness to correct for both the numerical issues and structural nonexchangability we see in these DAGs. In [Chapter -@sec-sensitivity], we'll also discuss sensitivity analyses for missingness and measurement error.\n\n## Regression Calibration\n\nSometimes, you have a well-measured version of a variable for a subset of observations and a version with more measurement error for a greater proportion of the dataset. When this is the case, you can use a simple approach called *regression calibration* to predict the value of the well-measured version for more observations in the dataset. The name of this technique refers to the fact that you're recalibrating the variable that you've observed more of given the subset of values you have for the well-measured version. But other than that, it's just a prediction model that includes the version of the variable you have more observations of, as well as other variables you find important to the measurement process.\n\nAs we know, the actual wait times have a lot of missingness. What if we considered posted wait times as a proxy for actual wait times? In this case, we could redo the analysis of the effect of Extra Magic Morning on the calibrated version of actual wait times. \n\nFirst, we'll fit a model to predict `wait_minutes_actual_avg` using `wait_minutes_posted_avg`. Where `wait_minutes_actual_avg` is available we'll use that. If it's `NA`, we'll use the calibrated value.\n\n<!-- TODO: should we include the confounders in this model? they're also in the later model. Not quite analagous to multiple imputation but maybe closer to the idea of including predictors of censoring in censoring weights even if they're confounders in the later models. We also don't care if we induce a relationship between them and outcome because the coefficients themselves don't matter -->\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(splines)\nlibrary(touringplans)\nlibrary(broom)\ncalib_model <- lm(\n  wait_minutes_actual_avg ~\n    ns(wait_minutes_posted_avg, df = 4) * wait_hour +\n    park_temperature_high + park_close + park_ticket_season,\n  # use log of `wait_minutes_actual_avg`\n  data = seven_dwarfs_train_2018 |> \n    mutate(wait_minutes_actual_avg = log1p(wait_minutes_actual_avg))\n)\n\nseven_dwarves_calib <- calib_model |> \n  augment(newdata = seven_dwarfs_train_2018) |> \n  rename(wait_minutes_actual_calib = .fitted) |> \n  # convert back to original scale \n  # and fill in real values where they exist\n  mutate(\n    wait_minutes_actual_calib = exp(wait_minutes_actual_calib) - 1,\n    wait_minutes_actual_calib = coalesce(\n      wait_minutes_actual_avg, \n      wait_minutes_actual_calib\n    )\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nFitting this model with the IPW estimator results in an effect of 3.11, considerably attenuated compared to the values of `wait_minutes_posted_avg`.\n\n::: callout-warning\nThe regression calibration model introduces uncertainty into the estimates of calibrated variable.

When you add in measurement error and other types of bias, it can be nearly impossible to reason about. A partial solution to this problem is to off-load some of the reasoning from your brain into the computer. \n\nWe recommend writing down the causal mechanisms you think are at play in your research question, then use simulation to probe different strategies.\n\n1. Create a DAG that includes the missingness and mismeasurement generation process, as well as any other types of bias you think are important.\n2. Simulate data that match this process. Often, you'll want to simulate it to match different assumptions, such as the strength of mismeasurement or missingness as the relate to variables in the DAG.\n3. Check the results under different analysis strategies such as complete-case analysis vs. imputation. You may also want to calculate the nominal coverage for the confidence intervals (the proportion of confidence intervals attained through your simulation which contain the true value, e.g. for 95% confidence intervals, 95% of the confidence intervals from your simulation should contain the true result). \n\nAs with our general suggestion about DAGs, if you are unsure about the correct DAG, you should check to see how these results differe depending on the specificiation.\n::: \n",
